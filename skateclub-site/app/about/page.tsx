                    <p>
                        Founded by passionate skaters who wanted to create a space where students could connect through
                        skateboarding, UW Skateclub has grown into one of the most active communities on campus.

                        We believe skateboarding is more than just a sport – it's a form of self-expression, a way to
                        challenge yourself, and a path to building lasting friendships. Our club welcomes everyone,
                        from complete beginners to seasoned pros.
